# CSV Query
This is based on the idea of [rows](https://github.com/turicas/rows) but I want to limit it only to a fast CSV parser with the embeded sqlite query.

**This is still is not fully done**

## Installing
Assuming you already have cargo just run this:
```
 cargo install --git https://github.com/jaysonsantos/csv-query-rs
```
When the project is mature enough it will be sent to crates.io.
